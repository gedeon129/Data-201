Conclusion:

Key Findings:
BMI (Body Mass Index)
BMI is slightly higher in individuals with heart disease.
However, BMI alone is not a strong predictor — many individuals without heart disease also fall in the overweight range.
Smoking
A higher percentage of smokers were found in the heart disease group, suggesting a clear association.
This supports public health data linking smoking to cardiovascular risk.
3. Blood pressure : 
No strong visible relationship between blood pressure and heart disease was observed in this dataset.
Despite these results, medical research identifies high blood pressure as a major risk factor — the lack of difference here may be due to dataset limitations
4. Stress levels
Across all stress levels (low, medium, high), more people did not have heart disease than those who did.
While the difference is not dramatic, the trend supports the idea that stress may play a contributing role in heart health
5.Bootstrap Distribution of Triglyceride Median
The narrow confidence interval indicates that the estimate is relatively precise and stable, suggesting strong data consistency.



Recommendations:

Promote Lifestyle Interventions
Encourage weight management and healthy BMI through balanced diets and physical activity.
Public campaigns should emphasize exercise and reduce sedentary behavior.
Reduce Smoking and Alcohol Use
Implement and support smoking cessation programs.
Monitor alcohol intake and promote awareness about its impact on cardiovascular health.
Encourage Regular Screenings
Blood pressure levels should be routinely monitored, especially in adults over 40.
Early detection can significantly lower the risk of heart disease.
Target High-Risk Groups
Individuals with a family history of heart disease or with multiple risk factors (smoking + high BMI) should receive focused preventive care.
Education & Awareness
Use schools, workplaces, and community health centers to educate people on how their daily habits influence heart health.
Personalized advice from doctors based on risk profiles ( BMI, smoking, etc.) can be more effective than general advice.
